"""Tests for the operator-aside strip in image_alt.

Run from this directory:

    python3 -m unittest              # or: python3 test_image_alt.py

Stdlib only, and no network or model call: `_strip_meta` is a pure string
function, so the cases below are the real ones written out verbatim.

The incident behind them happened to the sibling Old Seoul bot, which runs
this same module: on 16 August 2026 the model answered the operator instead
of the reader, and a screen reader read the aside aloud before reaching the
description. This bot has logged no such leak, but its alt log is days old,
so absence proves very little and the exposure is identical.

The first guard could drop only two sentences from each end, and that aside
was exactly two. A third sentence of preamble would have shipped, which is
why the front of the strip is now unbounded.

The last three matter most. An over-eager strip is the worse bug of the two,
because it would quietly delete real description from live posts, and unlike
a leaked aside nobody would ever see what was lost.
