"""Describe an image for alt text, using claude -p's vision.

Until August 2026 this bot's alt text was a citation: title, year, archive.
That tells a blind reader who holds the photograph and nothing whatsoever
about the photograph, and it restated the post text almost word for word, so
the same line was read out twice. On a bot whose entire content IS the picture,
that is the weakest possible alt.

describe() sends the actual image bytes to the model and asks what is visible.
The caption goes along only as context to contradict-check against, never as
something to paraphrase: paraphrasing the caption is how the old alt ended up
describing provenance instead of pixels.

Best-effort by design. Any failure returns None and the caller falls back to
the attribution-only alt it used before, on the same principle the card bots
already follow: a missing description is not worth a missing post.

The reply is then scrubbed of remarks addressed to the operator rather than
the reader (see _strip_meta): those had been shipping to screen readers.

The model runs with cwd set to the temp directory holding the one image, so
the only file it can reach by a bare name is the one it is being asked about.

#
# It leads rather than trails because it exists to calibrate. Heard after the
# description, the listener has already built a picture on the assumption

#
# Callers must apply it ONLY to generated text. holmes_post.py falls back to

# statement of who drew the picture and where it appeared. Labelling it would

_PROMPT = """Write alt text for a blind reader of a social media post, describing the image ./{name}

Describe what is actually VISIBLE: the subject, the setting, the composition, any notable detail. One or two sentences, 40 words at most.

Rules:
- Describe only what you can see. Never state names, dates, places or events that are not visually evident, however likely they seem.
- That includes people: do not assign gender, age or role from clothing, hair or the caption. Write "four people" or "a figure seated on the ground" unless the illustration itself puts it beyond doubt.
- Attribute a detail only to the figures it is actually visible on. If three of four are barefoot, say three.
- Attribute a detail to the thing it actually belongs to, not to the thing nearest it. A canopy over the pavement is not the building's entrance canopy; a flower pinned to a coat is not a flower being held.
- Prefer a safe observation to a precise one. Do not name a thing you cannot actually resolve: if a small dark shape could be a figure or could be a tree trunk, leave it out rather than choose. A listener cannot check what you tell them, so an invented detail costs them more than a missing one.
- Do not give a number unless you have counted it. "Several people look on" beats "five other men look on" when you have not counted five, and the same goes for windows, storeys, doors and lawns.
- Open by naming the medium where it is not obvious, e.g. "Black-and-white photograph" or "Pen-and-ink illustration".
- Do not restate the caption below. It is read out separately, and repeating it is the flaw this replaces. Use it only to avoid contradicting what is known.
- UK English. No emoji, no markdown, no surrounding quotation marks.
- If the image cannot be read at all, reply with exactly CANNOT_SEE.
- Return ONLY the alt text and nothing else.

Caption, for context only (do not restate): {context}"""

# The verification pass
#
# Measured 27 August 2026 across all 118 descriptions the three model-written
# bots had shipped since 16 August: 35 of them (30%) asserted something the
# image does not support, and 6 (5%) named an object that is not in the frame
# at all — a newspaper in a cartoon figure's empty hands, a mountain behind a
# city lot, a "small figure walking" that is a tree trunk.
#
# ⚠️ THE PROMPT RULES ABOVE ARE NOT ENOUGH, and that is measured rather than
# assumed. everylibrary_describe.py already carries an explicit, well-argued
# rule against guessing storey counts; in the same sweep it guessed wrong five
# times in twenty-nine images. A rule written at a failure did not stop the
# failure. Asking more carefully is not a fix, so the description is now
# checked against the image before it ships.
#
# ⚠️ The check asks a DIFFERENT QUESTION from the one that wrote the text —
# locate each asserted thing, rather than judge the sentence. A verifier asked
# "is this description good?" largely agrees with itself. It is also
# deliberately NOT given the caption: the caption is where imported facts come
# from, and a verifier holding it will happily confirm them.
#
# ⚠️ It runs INSIDE describe(), on the bare description. Callers prepend the
# citation ("Seoul Metropolitan Archives, 1965.") and everylibrary appends a
# note from Commons, and both assert things no image can show — an archive's
# name, a date, "the council contact centre out the back". Verifying the
# assembled alt reports every one of those as unsupported. The sweep that led
# to this made exactly that mistake and scored three human-written claims as
# model hallucinations before they were caught by hand.
#
# ⚠️ A CHECK THAT COULD NOT BE MADE DOES NOT BLOCK THE POST. It logs that the
# description is unverified and ships it anyway, which is this module's
# standing contract: it must never be the thing that ends a run. Falling back
# to the citation whenever the verifier has a bad morning would trade a rare
# wrong description for a frequent absent one, and the absent one is worse for
# every reader on every other day. What it must never do is report that
# silence as a pass — hence the unparseable-reply guard in _unsupported().
#
# ⛔⛔ WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, measured on the image that prompted it.
# Old Seoul's post of 27 August 2026 (3mtzk5pwq4w2q, Deoksu Palace in snow)
# shipped "a small figure walking along a cleared path". There is no figure:
# it is the trunk of a snow-laden tree, about 36px tall in a 539x447 frame,
# roughly 8% of the height. The verifier was run against that image and
# reported "FOUND | small figure walking | tiny person standing/walking on the
# cleared path in front of the building". It shares the describer's blind spot
# exactly, and the rewritten prompt above does not help either: a fresh
# describe() on the same image still says "a small figure standing".
#
# So this check is worth having and is NOT a solution to the general problem.
# It catches the large classes measured in the same sweep — miscounted people
# and storeys, wrong roofs, wrong colours, a canopy borrowed from a bus
# shelter next door — and it does not catch a small, low-contrast feature that
# genuinely looks like the thing it is mistaken for. The 30% figure above is
# therefore a FLOOR, not a measurement of everything wrong: the snow post was
# scored clean by the very sweep that produced it.
#
# What actually settled that image was cropping the region and looking at it
# enlarged, which nothing in this path does. If this failure class is ever
# worth closing, that is the direction — magnify the asserted detail and ask
# again — not a third rewording of either prompt.
