"""Describe an image for alt text, using claude -p's vision.

Until August 2026 this bot's alt text was a citation: title, year, archive.
That tells a blind reader who holds the photograph and nothing whatsoever
about the photograph, and it restated the post text almost word for word, so
the same line was read out twice. On a bot whose entire content IS the picture,
that is the weakest possible alt.

describe() sends the actual image bytes to the model and asks what is visible.
The caption goes along only as context to contradict-check against, never as
something to paraphrase: paraphrasing the caption is how the old alt ended up
describing provenance instead of pixels.

Best-effort by design. Any failure returns None and the caller falls back to
the attribution-only alt it used before, on the same principle the card bots
already follow: a missing description is not worth a missing post.

The reply is then scrubbed of remarks addressed to the operator rather than
the reader (see _strip_meta): those had been shipping to screen readers.

The model runs with cwd set to the temp directory holding the one image, so
the only file it can reach by a bare name is the one it is being asked about.

# post, an embed. The reader who most needs to know is the one least likely
# to have seen it.
#
# It leads rather than trails because it exists to calibrate. Heard after the
# description, the listener has already built a picture on the assumption
# that someone looked at the illustration. Heard first, they weigh the rest
# as they go. Three words is a fair price for that, on descriptions the
# audience for alt text is by definition unable to check.
#
# Callers must apply it ONLY to generated text. holmes_post.py falls back to
# an attribution string when describe() returns None, and that is a human
# statement of who drew the picture and where it appeared. Labelling it would
# be a false claim in the opposite direction.

_PROMPT = """Write alt text for a blind reader of a social media post, describing the image ./{name}

Describe what is actually VISIBLE: the subject, the setting, the composition, any notable detail. One or two sentences, 40 words at most.

Rules:
- Describe only what you can see. Never state names, dates, places or events that are not visually evident, however likely they seem.
- That includes people: do not assign gender, age or role from clothing, hair or the caption. Write "four people" or "a figure seated on the ground" unless the illustration itself puts it beyond doubt.
- Attribute a detail only to the figures it is actually visible on. If three of four are barefoot, say three.
- Open by naming the medium where it is not obvious, e.g. "Black-and-white photograph" or "Pen-and-ink illustration".
- Do not restate the caption below. It is read out separately, and repeating it is the flaw this replaces. Use it only to avoid contradicting what is known.
- UK English. No emoji, no markdown, no surrounding quotation marks.
- If the image cannot be read at all, reply with exactly CANNOT_SEE.
- Return ONLY the alt text and nothing else.

Caption, for context only (do not restate): {context}"""

# The model sometimes answers the operator instead of the reader. On 15 August
# 2026 an alt shipped from the sibling Old Seoul bot, through this same module,

#   "Note: this image doesn't match the caption, it shows a rooftop pigeon
#    coop, not a city plaza. Flagging that before giving alt text.
#    Black-and-white photograph of a wooden rooftop shed with wire-mesh
#    cages, dozens of pigeons taking flight above the roofline..."
#
# so a screen reader user heard the aside before reaching the description.
# "Return ONLY the alt text" was a prompt instruction with nothing enforcing
# it, and the contradiction-check rule invites the leak: the model is told to
# check the caption for contradictions and has nowhere to report one it finds.

# Ported here because this bot runs the same prompt through the same path, so
# it has always been exposed to the same leak. Its logged posts show none, but

# sensitive: a lowercase bare "i" is a stray character, not a pronoun, and
